# Squash-Game

Please clone both the files for the project to work at your end.
The extras file is required for the project file to work.
In the interaction window, give simulation 1/24 to make it work.
An animation window would appear with a circle representing the ball in 
a squash game and a rectangle representing the racket.
To start the game, press the spacebar.
To move the racket you need to change the velocity of the racket and
to get multiple balls you can press the b button on the keyboard
The velocity of the racket can be changed using the arrow keys-
pressing the left arrow key decreases the vx component by 1
pressing the right arrow key increases the vx component by 1
pressing the up arrow key decreases the vy component by 1
pressing the  down arrow key increases the vy component by 1
The racket can also be moved with the help of the mouse.
To pause the game press the spacebar again.
Pressing the pause button, pauses everything for 3 secs and turns the 
screen to yellow, after which the racket and ball go back to their 
initial position as before the game.
Once the last ball strikes the bottom of the window, the game again goes 
to the paused state.
